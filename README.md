# SoC-Sentiment Analysis


This repository documents my journey in learning sentiment analysis techniques over a 5-week period.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into 5 weeks of learning:

1. Introduction to Sentiment Analysis
2. Data Pre-processing and Visualization
3. Machine Learning Algorithms
4. Deep Learning
5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Week 1: Introduction

- Learned key terminologies: Sentiment Analysis, Machine Learning
- Set up environment: Jupyter/Colab Notebook
- Explored basic libraries: NumPy, Pandas

## Week 2: Data Pre-processing and Visualization

- Learned data cleaning and preparation techniques
- Used Matplotlib for data visualization
- Practiced data splitting and normalization
- Explored feature selection methods

## Week 3: Machine Learning Algorithms

- Implemented algorithms using sklearn:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- Learned about classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## Week 4: Deep Learning

- Studied Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Explored Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization

## Week 5: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Learned file operations in Python
- Studied Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Explored Stemming and Lemmatization
- Understood Stop Words concepts
- Practiced Part of Speech Tagging and Named Entity Recognition

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Jupyter/Google Colab
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (introduced)

## Next Steps

- Apply learned concepts to real-world sentiment analysis tasks
- Complete the final project on IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews

## Resources

Each week included specific resources (videos, articles, and tutorials) provided by the mentor.
